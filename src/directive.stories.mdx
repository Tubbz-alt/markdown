# Directive

This package includes a Vue directive for easy integration with your project.
Simply include it in your component, and write some markdown!

```vue
<template>
  <article v-markdown.full>
    # This will be parsed as full markdown

    So type away!
  </article>
</template>

<script>
  import { directive as markdownDirective } from '@system76/markdown'

  export default {
    directives: {
      markdown: markdownDirective
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Using

There are multiple ways you can use this directive. You can pass in text as a
variable like so:

```vue
<template>
  <article v-markdown.full="markdownText" />
</template>
```

or you can use it to parse some inline text like so:

```vue
<template>
  <article v-markdown.full>
    # This will be parsed as full markdown

    So type away!
  </article>
</template>
```

## Options

You can also parse inline markdown if you do not include the `.full` modifier.

```vue
<template>
  <p v-markdown="bodyText" />
</template>
```

would parse into this:

```vue
<template>
  <p>this is <strong>some</strong> body text</p>
</template>
```

# Server Directive

If you are using Vue for SSR, you will also want to include the server directive
to ensure the markdown gets parsed correctly on the server. The easiest way to
do this is with Nuxt. Just include it in your `nuxt.config.js` file like so:

```js
import { serverDirective as serverMarkdownDirective } from '@system76/markdown'

export default {
  render: {
    bundleRenderer: {
      directives: {
        markdown: serverMarkdownDirective
      }
    }
  }
}
```
