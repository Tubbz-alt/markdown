# Markdown

This markdown configuration has a lot of useful plugins and extensions enabled
by default to make sure the content.

### Links

Links will automatically be converted when detected in markdown. If it is an
http or https link, it will automatically get `target="_blank"` and
`rel="noopener"` attributes.

```markdown
This is an https://example.com link
```

becomes

```html
This is an <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example.com</a> link
```

### Keyboard Keys

We will automatically convert markdown that has `[[` and `]]` in it to `<kbd>`
and `</kbd>` keys.

```markdown
This is a [[ctrl]] key.
```

becomes

```html
This is a <kbd>ctrl</kbd> key.
```

### Quotes

Normal single and double quotes will be converted to proper quotes when parsed.

```markdown
"We"
```

becomes

```html
“We”
```
