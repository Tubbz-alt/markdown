This Standard Terms and Conditions for Sale Agreement ("Agreement")
contains the terms and conditions that apply to any order, purchase,
receipt, delivery or use of any products from System76 Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, "System76"). By accepting
delivery of the product(s) purchased from System76 and described on your
invoice, you agree to be bound by and accept the following terms and
conditions. Any attempt to alter, supplement or amend this document or to
enter an order for a product(s) that is subject to additional or altered
terms and conditions will be null and void, unless otherwise agreed to in a
written agreement signed by both you and System76. These terms and
conditions are subject to change without prior written notice at any time,
in System76's sole discretion.

## Definitions.

"We", "us" and/or "our" means System76.

"You" or "your" means the individual or entity named on the invoice.

## Payment Terms, Orders, and Interest.

Advertised prices are in U.S. dollars and, unless otherwise noted,
exclude shipping, handling and any taxes that may be imposed by the legal
authority that governs the jurisdiction in which you reside. Terms of
payment are within System76's sole discretion, and unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by System76, payment must be received by System76 before
System76's acceptance of an order. Invoice amounts are due and payable
within the period noted on the invoice, measured from the date of the
invoice. System76 may invoice parts of an order separately. You agree to
pay interest on all past-due sums at the highest rate allowed by law.
System76 is not responsible for pricing, typographical or other errors in
any offer by System76 and we reserve the unilateral right to cancel any
orders resulting from such errors.

## Taxes.

Unless otherwise indicated on the face of the invoice, you are
responsible for paying all taxes associated with your order.

## Shipping, Title and Risk of Loss.

Shipping and handling are additional unless otherwise expressly
indicated at the time of sale. Loss or damage that occurs during shipping
by a carrier selected by System76 is System76's responsibility. Loss or
damage that occurs during shipping by a carrier selected by you is your
responsibility. Title to software remains with the licensor of the
software. Your use of software is subject to license agreements applicable
to the software. Shipping dates are only estimates. You must notify System

possible. The parts and assemblies used in building System76 products are
selected from new and equivalent-to-new parts and assemblies in accordance
with industry practices. Spare parts may be new or reconditioned. The
quoted System76 SKU numbers for System76-branded hardware products are of
the quality specified by System76 on its website and conform in all
material respects with the System76 product specification current on the
date such products were shipped.
